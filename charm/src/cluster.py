"""Peer-relation coordination for the microcloud charm.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Publish this unit's MicroCloud identity (hostname + bind address) on the
  peer relation databag.
- Collect the identities of all peer units so the leader can assemble the
  full ``systems`` list for preseed.
- Manage the shared session passphrase via a Juju secret (leader-owned),
  falling back to the configured value when provided.
- Validate consistency between Juju units and MicroCloud members (matched on
  hostname), in both directions.
